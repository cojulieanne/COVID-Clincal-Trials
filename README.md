# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID Clinical Trials

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook containing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID clinical trials data. The dataset provides valuable insights into ongoing clinical trials related to COVID-19, including trial characteristics, locations, sponsors, and more.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about COVID clinical trials sourced from various registries and databases. It includes fields such as:

- Trial ID
- Title
- Phase
- Status
- Start Date
- Completion Date
- Locations
- Sponsors
- Enrollment
- and more.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before conducting the analysis, we perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including:

- Handling missing values
- Standardizing date formats
- Parsing and cleaning text fields
- Encoding categorical variables
- Exploring and removing outliers
- and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., to understand the distribution of key variables.

2. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations, including histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots, to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover insights.

3. **Temporal Analysis**: Analyzing trends and patterns over time, including trial start dates, completion dates, and enrollment rates.

4. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping trial locations to visualize geographical distribution and identify hotspots of clinical trial activity.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing trial characteristics, phases, statuses, sponsors, and enrollment across different regions or categories.

## Key Findings

Based on our analysis, we uncover several key findings and insights, including:

- Distribution of clinical trials by phase and status
- Temporal trends in trial start dates and completion dates
- Geographical distribution of trials across different countries and regions
- Comparison of trial characteristics between different sponsors, phases, and statuses
- Insights into enrollment rates and patient demographics.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA provides valuable insights into COVID clinical trials data, helping researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals better understand the landscape of ongoing trials and make informed decisions.
